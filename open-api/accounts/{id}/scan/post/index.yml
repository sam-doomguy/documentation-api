description: This endpoint allows you to run Conformity Bot for the specified account.
  This operation makes API calls to AWS on your behalf.
  Amazon throttles API requests for each AWS account on a per-region basis to help the performance of the service.
  To avoid API throttling, it's important to ensure that your application doesn't use this API at a high rate.
  Refer to [AWS Service Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) to find out more about AWS throttle rate.
